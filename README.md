### What I Do

<p style="font-size: 18px;">I'm a backend engineer and my main stack consists of <b>TypeScript, Node.js, NestJS, and PostgreSQL</b>. I enjoy designing scalable, efficient systems and solving challenging problems with <b>creative solutions</b>.</p>

Currently, I'm working on my multiplayer game, where I get to combine my love for <b>math, problem-solving, and game development</b>.

> This game is for PC only. It isn't playable on other devices

<p>I built this game to gain overview of game development in <b>Unity</b>.</p>
<p>I've got high overview of camera, animations, scenes, input system, UI, prefabs, scriptable objects, music and sound effects...</p>
<p>I couldn't have done it alone. Ask me about it.</p>

<p>Built <b>mathematical model</b> to solve the problem of self-intersecting meshes and jagged curves in <b>3D traffic management game</b></p>
<p>It involved working with <b>Cubic Bezier Curves</b>, <b>Linear Algebra</b> and <b>Spline Tool</b></p>
